# Credit Scorecard and Automatic Monitoring System Using Python

Here are two Jupyter Notebook files that contain the models and systems I built while working at a financial company.

1. [Credit Scorecard_XGBoost.ipynb](https://github.com/Jintong1997/Credit-score-card-XGBoost-and-Automation-monitoring-system-/blob/main/Credit%20Score%20Card_XGBoost.ipynb) is a credit scorecard I built using XGBoost.
2. [Monitor.ipynb](https://github.com/Jintong1997/Credit-score-card-XGBoost-and-Automation-monitoring-system-/blob/main/automation%20model%20monitor.ipynb) is an automated model monitoring system that I built to monitor the models.
